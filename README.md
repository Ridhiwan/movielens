In different networks and services users have the ability to rate and share their comments on movies, series or shows that they have watched. 
The feedback given by the users helps the service provider to know which kinds of movies perform better than others in a given demographic. 
This allows the service provider to improve their offerings. In this project we will make a movie recommendation system that displays certain kinds of movies to a user depending on how they rated the movies they previously watched or depending on what other similar users have previously watched and rated. This will allow the service provider to order different movies for different users more accurately for the goal of creating satisfied customers.
